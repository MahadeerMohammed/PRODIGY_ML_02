Grouping customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using K-means Clustering Algorithm.

## Features

  - This project aims to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using the K-Means clustering algorithm.
  - By analyzing customer purchasing behavior, we can identify distinct customer groups and tailor marketing strategies, product recommendations, and promotions accordingly.


## Key Features
  - Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
  - K-Means Clustering: Implements the K-Means algorithm to group customers based on purchase patterns.
  - Customer Profiling: Creates profiles for each customer segment, highlighting key characteristics.
  - Visualization: Provides visual representations of customer clusters and their relationships.
